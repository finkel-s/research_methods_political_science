The course will begin with the logic of social scientific inquiry and the basics of research design, and then introduce students to the quantitative and qualitative methods that are commonly used by political scientists to investigate important questions about the political world.\nThe goals of the course are:\n\nFor the student to become both an intelligent consumer of quantitative and qualitative research, with the ability to see the strengths and flaws of social scientific studies in academic journals and books, newspapers, websites, and other outlets.\n\nTo give students the skills necessary to begin conducting original political science research studies of their own.\n\nBy the end of the class, students will have developed a critical understanding of issues related to scientific inquiry, measurement, causal inference, experimental, quasi-experimental and observational research, formal modeling, comparative research, sampling and survey research, focus groups, in-depth interviewing, case studies and other qualitative methods of data collection.\nStudents will also learn fundamental concepts in descriptive and inferential statistics, and in data analytic techniques such as crosstabulation, correlation and regression analysis, and will develop the skills to apply these methods using the R statistical package."
