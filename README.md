## Course Description

This course serves as an introduction to the methodology of political science research. The course will begin with the logic of social scientific inquiry and the basics of research design, and then introduce students to the quantitative and qualitative methods that are commonly used by political scientists to investigate important questions about the political world.

The goals of the course are:  

1. For the student to become both an intelligent consumer of quantitative and qualitative research, with the ability to see the strengths and flaws of social scientific studies in academic journals and books, newspapers, websites, and other outlets.  
2. To give students the skills necessary to begin conducting original political science research studies of their own.

By the end of the class, students will have developed a critical understanding of issues related to scientific inquiry, measurement, causal inference, experimental, quasi-experimental and observational research, formal modeling, comparative research, sampling and survey research, focus groups, in-depth interviewing, case studies and other qualitative methods of data collection.

Students will also learn fundamental concepts in descriptive and inferential statistics, and in data analytic techniques such as cross tabulation, correlation and regression analysis, and will develop the skills to apply these methods using the R statistical package.

## Texts

- Kellstedt, Paul M. and Guy D. Whitten. 2018. *The Fundamentals of Political Science Research*, 3rd Edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

Students will be using **R** for learning the various statistical techniques and for conducting the research exercise. We'll provide step-by-step instructions in using R as the course progresses. You can find general introductions in:

- Imai, Kosuke. 2017. *Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction*, Princeton University Press.
- Wickham, Hadley, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. 2023. *R for Data Science* (2nd ed.). O’Reilly Media. Available at: [https://r4ds.hadley.nz/](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

## Course Requirements

Grades will be based on three exams, one research exercise, and participation in class discussion and the recitation section. The first two exams will be held in-class, and the last exam will be held at the normal scheduled time during finals week.

The research exercise will be an approximately seven-page paper in which you:

- Specify hypothesized relationships between political variables;
- Use R to test the hypotheses with quantitative methods on data that will be made available to you; and,
- Interpret the results of the analyses.

## Course Outline

The course is organized by units and then topics within units. We will maintain a certain amount of flexibility with the schedule, so that we can spend more time on some topics/units and scale back on others as circumstances warrant.
